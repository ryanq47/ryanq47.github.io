# Intro
---

In this writeup, I take on a forensics challenge from the USCG CTF 2024, titled "Timing is Everything." The challenge provides a PCAP file that initially seems to showcase routine network communication between two hosts using the ICMP protocol, but is infact hiding data via a clever trick. I don't want to spoil said trick in the intro, so read on!


# Methodology and Approach
---
## Initial Exploration

Forensics challenges have a million ways to approach them, depending on the challenge type. This challenge gives us a PCAP, which usually means wireshark.

The PCAP is pretty simple, we see that there's only two hosts talking to each other, and the only protocol used between them is ICMP.

Scrolling through each packet reveals that each one is the exact same! That's odd, networks don't usually work like that. The one thing that changes, is *when* the packets are sent. That, along with the fact that the challenge is called `timing is everything` probably means that there's something hidden in the timing of these packets.

## Dissecting Timestamps

There's a few ways to potentially hide data in timestamps, but the first thing I notice, is that the second packet is exactly `0.083000` seconds after the first. If we look at the rest of the packets, all of them are unusually exact for a PCAP. Maybe `0.083000` could be a number for something?

I checked out a UTF-8 Table, and would you look at that, `83` translates into `S`. All the flags are in the format of `SIVUSCG{FLAG}` - so this is a promising lead.

Just to verify, I checked the time on the next packet as well, `0.156000`, which translates to `Å“` in UTF-8. That can't be right? 

`0.156000` happens to be bigger than `0.083000`, in fact, each packets timestamp is subsequently larger. If we go ahead and subtract  `0.083000` from `0.156000`, we get `0.73`, which translates to `I`. That fits the flag format! 

## Scripting it out
This PCAP is small enough that the flag could be extracted by hand, but if there were thousands of packets, like in a real world scenario, it's inefficient to do so. I did a bit of python scripting, and with some help from the scapy library, was able to pull the timestamp of each packet, and subtract them as needed.

Running this script, we get the following:

```
083 073 086 085 083 067 071 123 084 049 109 049 11 057 095 049 053 095 051 118 051 114 121 116 104 049 11 057 125
```

If I toss those numbers in CyberChef, and select the `From Decimal` operation, I get the following:

## Script Bug

Well, that's close... but why are there newlines? Turns out there's a bug in my script, when I strip the trailing 0's, it messes with some of the numbers, specifically turning `110` into `11`

I could fix this, but the most efficient route in this case is to just add those 0's back in CyberChef:

```
SIVUSCG{T1m1n9_15_3v3ryth1n9}
```

Bingo! There we go, we've got the flag! 

## Final Thoughts

This was an incredibly fun challenge. I love the concept of using timestamps to hide data, it's a sweet little trick. I question the applicability of this to a real world scenario, mainly due to unavoidable/unpredictable latency over networks, but nevertheless, still a cool idea.
